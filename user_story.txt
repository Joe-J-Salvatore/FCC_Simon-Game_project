// User is presented with random button highlights
// Each time user correctly presses button pattern a new step is added to the series of random highlights
// a sound plays for each button highlight and when the user presses correct buttons
// When user presses the wrong button he/she is norified by sound and/or visual cue
// The pattern replays following an incorrect button press
// A visual cue notifies the user of how many steps are in the current pattern
// A restart button will return the game to a single step
// Strict mode is available as an option: game restarts once user presses one wrong button
// A user wins and is notified if he/she presses 20 correct buttons in a series ... the game restarts

-- JS generates a random number, which corresponds to a letter in the word 'says' and its color
-- The letter/color shifts visually and moves 
-- The random number gets stored in an array
-- Player mimics game by clicking on previously highlighted letter
-- if the letter is correct it highlights the same and moves, else shakes and highlights 'black'
-- Player's choice is stored in another array and continuously checked against game array
-- the stored game array replays and adds a new random number (letter/color) on succesive steps
-- Once the game array.length equals 20 the game ends
-- If the player matches the game through 20 steps they win, else the stored series of random numbers replays
